# Hi there 👋
I'm Basile and I'm a fullstack web developer from Brussels. I actually work with React and Node.js after a 6 month bootcamp at the [WildCodeSchool](https://www.wildcodeschool.com) and serval years of experience as a web integrator.

> Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.”

📚 Hard learner and curious (about... pretty much everything)<br/>
